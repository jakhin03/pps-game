## Key Insights

### Gamma Control Effect

- **Lowest Gamma (1)**: 8 violations
- **Highest Gamma (800)**: 0 violations
- **✅ Gamma Control Confirmed**: Higher gamma reduces violations
- **Violation Reduction**: 8 violations (100.0%)

### Control Knob Analysis

- **Low Gamma**: Average 6.5 violations (system accepts violations for efficiency)
- **Medium Gamma**: Average 2.5 violations (balanced approach)
- **High Gamma**: Average 0.3 violations (strict rule adherence)

## Conclusion

The penalty cost gamma demonstrates clear effectiveness as a 'control knob' for balancing:
- **Rule Adherence**: Higher gamma enforces stricter constraint compliance
- **Operational Efficiency**: Lower gamma allows flexibility for operational needs
- **System Design**: Gamma can be tuned based on specific operational requirements
