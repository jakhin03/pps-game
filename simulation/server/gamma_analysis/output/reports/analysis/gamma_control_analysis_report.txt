GAMMA CONTROL EFFECT ANALYSIS REPORT
==================================================
Generated: 2025-06-30 21:14:05

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------
This analysis demonstrates how gamma acts as an effective 'control knob'
for balancing violation prevention with operational efficiency.

KEY FINDINGS
---------------
• Violation Reduction: 100.0% (from γ=0 to γ=max)
• Cost Increase: 1457.7% (trade-off for compliance)
• Optimal Gamma: 5.0 (best efficiency balance)

GAMMA EFFECT ZONES
--------------------
LOW GAMMA (0.0 - 0.5):
  • System chooses to violate constraints
  • Penalty cost is too small to deter violations
  • Average violations: 35.3

MEDIUM GAMMA (0.5 - 2.0):
  • Balanced trade-off between violations and cost
  • System starts finding alternative paths
  • Average violations: 14.3

HIGH GAMMA (2.0+):
  • Penalty too costly, violations eliminated
  • System prioritizes compliance over efficiency
  • Average violations: 0.0

RECOMMENDATIONS
-----------------
• Use γ = 5.0 for optimal efficiency
• For strict compliance: use γ ≥ 5.0
• For cost optimization: use γ ≈ 1.0
• Monitor violation trends when adjusting γ

CONCLUSION
------------
Gamma penalty effectively acts as a 'control knob' allowing system
designers to fine-tune the balance between strict rule adherence
and operational efficiency. The exponential decay of violations
with increasing gamma demonstrates clear controllability.
