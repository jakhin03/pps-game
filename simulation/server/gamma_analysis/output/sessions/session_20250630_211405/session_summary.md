# Gamma Control Analysis Session Summary

**Generated:** 2025-06-30 21:14:32
**Session Directory:** `/home/ubuntu/project/pps-game/server/core/gamma_analysis/output/session_20250630_211405`

## Experiment Configuration

- **Gamma Values Tested:** [0.0, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 10.0]
- **Runs per Gamma:** 3
- **Total Simulations:** 21

## Expected Gamma Control Effects

Based on the gamma penalty mechanism, we expect to observe:

### 1. Violation Reduction
- **Low Gamma (0.0-0.5):** Minimal violation prevention
- **Medium Gamma (1.0-2.0):** Moderate violation reduction
- **High Gamma (5.0-10.0):** Strong violation prevention

### 2. Cost Increase
- Higher gamma values should increase path planning costs
- Trade-off between violation prevention and computational efficiency

### 3. Escape Edge Usage
- More escape edges used as gamma increases
- Alternative paths chosen to avoid violations

## Generated Files

## Key Insights to Look For

When reviewing the generated charts and reports, pay attention to:

1. **Violation vs Gamma Correlation**
   - Negative correlation indicates effective violation control
   - Look for the "knee" point where diminishing returns occur

2. **Cost vs Gamma Trade-off**
   - Linear or exponential cost increase with gamma
   - Identify optimal gamma for best violation/cost balance

3. **Success Rate Stability**
   - Success rate should remain high across gamma values
   - Drops may indicate gamma values that are too high

4. **Escape Edge Utilization**
   - Should increase with gamma as alternative paths are explored
   - Indicates the system is actively avoiding violations

## How to Interpret Results

### Visualization Files

  - Top-left: Violations vs Gamma (should decrease)
  - Top-right: Cost vs Gamma (should increase)
  - Bottom-left: Escape Edges vs Gamma (should increase)
  - Bottom-right: Violations vs Cost scatter (colored by gamma)

- **`gamma_trend_analysis.png`**: Detailed trend analysis showing:
  - Normalized trends for easy comparison
  - Success rates across gamma values
  - Efficiency metric (violations per cost unit)

- **`gamma_distributions.png`**: Box plots showing:
  - Distribution of metrics for each gamma value
  - Variability and outliers in the data

## Recommended Analysis Steps

1. **Review Analysis Report** (`analysis_report.txt`)
   - Read key findings and correlations
   - Note the suggested optimal gamma value

2. **Examine Main Visualization** (`gamma_analysis_overview.png`)
   - Verify expected trends (violations down, costs up)
   - Look for optimal balance point

3. **Check Trend Analysis** (`gamma_trend_analysis.png`)
   - Review normalized trends for clear patterns
   - Examine efficiency metric curve

4. **Validate Data Quality** (`experiment_data.csv`)
   - Ensure successful runs across all gamma values
   - Check for any anomalous results
